  Fix faulty cable conneciton on an 2018 BH EVO Street E-bike
==========================================


When I got this bike I had to hold the "battery test" button on the battery for over 5 seconds to bring the battery out of "deep sleep" mode.  If you don't you can't turn on the bike with the handlebar button.

This bike was displaying an "Err 03" on the display which was a torque sensor error.  The rear derailleur is mounted to the torque sensor.  Before I removed the torque sensor to examine it I thought I'd pop off the controller cover to see if I could find where the torque sensor cable comes in.

Here is a photo of the bike:

This shows the internal connection of the display and on/off button.  Also the battery connector and voltages while the battery was in deep sleep. (the first number is normal mode, the second is the brief period when the LED's are lit when pushing the "battery test" button on the battery. The chart on the lower right shows resistance measurements.

Here is the battery connector:

and the battery model number:

Here is a photo of the cover that needs to be removed to expose the torque sensor connector.  You need to first remove the battery connector block and then the 3 T20 Torx screws on the cover.  It also helps to remove the 2 hex screws a little so that the lock will move out of the way when you try to get the cover off.

  Here shows the torque sensor connector after the cover has been removed.

  Use needle nose pliers to take apart the connector, maybe clean the conntacts with contact cleaner, and then plug back together.  If you're lucky the "Err 03" will go away.
